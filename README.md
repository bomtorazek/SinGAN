### Official pytorch implementation of the paper: "SinGAN: Learning a Generative Model from a Single Natural Image"
####  ICCV 2019


## Random samples from a *single* image
With SinGAN, you can train a generative model from a single natural image, and then generate random samples form the given image, for example:

![](imgs/teaser.PNG)


## SinGAN's applications
SinGAN can be also use to a line of image manipulation task, for example:
 ![](imgs/manipulation.PNG)
This is done by injecting an image to the already trained model. See section 4 in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf) for more details.


## Code
###  Train
To train SinGAN model on your own image, put the desire training image under Input/Images, and run

```
python main_train.py --input_name <input_file_name>
```

This will also use the resulting trained model to generate random samples starting from the coarsest scale (n=0).

###  Random samples
To generate random samples from any starting generation scale, please first train SinGAN model for the desire image (as described above), then run 

```
python random_samples.py --input_name <training_image_file_name> --mode random_samples --gen_start_scale <generation start scale number>
```

pay attention: for using the full model, specify the generation start scale to be 0, to start the generation from the second scale, specify it to be 1, and so on. 

###  Random samples of arbitrery sizes
To generate random samples of arbitrery sizes, please first train SinGAN model for the desire image (as described above), then run 

```
python random_samples.py --input_name <training_image_file_name> --mode random_samples_arbitrary_sizes --scale_h <horizontal scaling factor> --scale_v <vertical scaling factor>
```

###  Animation from a single image

To generate short animation from a single image, run

```
python animation.py --input_name <input_file_name> 
```

This will automatically start a new training phase with noise padding mode.

###  Harmonization

To harmonize a pasted object into an image (See example in Fig. 13 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf)), please first train SinGAN model for the desire background image (as described above), then save the naively pasted reference image and it's binary mask under "Input/Harmonization" (see saved images for an example). Run the command

```
python harmonization.py --input_name <training_image_file_name> --ref_name <naively_pasted_reference_image_file_name> --harmonization_start_scale <scale to inject>

```

Please note that different injection scale will produce different harmonization effects. The coarsest injection scale equals 1. 

###  Editing

To edit an image, (See example in Fig. 12 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf)), please first train SinGAN model on the desire non-edited image (as described above), then save the naive edit as a reference image under "Input/Editing" with a corresponding binary map (see saved images for an example). Run the command

```
python editing.py --input_name <training_image_file_name> --ref_name <edited_image_file_name> --editing_start_scale <scale to inject>

```
both the masked and unmasked output will be saved.
Here as well, different injection scale will produce different editing effects. The coarsest injection scale equals 1. 

### Super Resolution
To super resolve an image, Please run:
```
python3 SR.py --input_name <LR_image_file_name>
```
This will aoutomatically train a SinGAN model correspond to 4x upsampling factor (if not exist already).
For different SR factors, please specify it using the parametr 'sr_factor' when calling the function.
SinGAN's results on BSD100 dataset can be download from the 'Downloads' folder.
